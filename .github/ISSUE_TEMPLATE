Thank you for filing an issue!

It would help us tremendously if you provid the following so that we can easily
reproduce your issue:

1. A link to a Git repository containing a branch of `cartographer_ros`
   containing all the configuration, launch, and URDF files required to
   reproduce your issue.
2. A link to a bag file we can use to reproduce your issue.

We will likely be unable to help you without both.
