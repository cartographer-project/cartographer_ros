Thank you for filing an issue to make our software better.

If you have trouble getting things to run or have tuning issues, please make
sure to provide:

1. A link to a Git repository containing a branch of `cartographer_ros` with
   your configuration files checked in. This allows us to understand what you
   changed and the exact steps you took to get to the point were you are stuck.
2. A link to download the bag file you are testing agains.

We will be unable to help you without both.
